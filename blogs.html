		<h3>AI Regulation</h3>
		<p>
		  AI should be regulated by the government. AI is a rapidly growing and changing techonlogy that needs regulation in order to keep people safe. AI is already using content from the internet and stealing information from their original owners. AI also has the ability to steal jobs from millions if it is not well regulated. If the government steps in and regulates AI, it will show everyone that AI can be helpful to us instead of dangerous.

		<h3>BYOD</h3>
		<p>
		  The BYOD policy change is a very stupid way to try and regulate students activty in school. Many students have bought devices just for school now their money will go to waste. They think that removing the BYOD wifi will stop students from bringing their own devices, but this is not the case. Students can still just connect to the guest wifi and use a VPN. There is no point in regulating wifi and student devices. Even colleges dont regulate student devices and school wifi. If they want high school to be prep for college then they should copy some of their policies as well. I personally feel that this policy change is just a way for them to save money on internet bills.
