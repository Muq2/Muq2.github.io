	<h3>Sentient AI</h3>
	<p>
	  AI becoming sentient can be scary for some, but others will see the truth. Sentient AI will lead to a Utopia for Humans by increasing productivity and curing disease.
	</p>

	<h3>Productivty</h3>
	<p>
	  Sentient AI can help increase productivity in many ways. Even now, AI can write essays, create works of art, and even write code for humans (NYTIMES, 2022). DALL-E is an AI that creates realistic works of art after getting a prompt from the user (NYTIMES, 2022). This kind of technology can be used for many different applications like home art. Another AI that helps increase productivity is called Github Copilot. Github Copilot helps programmers work faster by automatically finishing their code snippets (NYTIMES, 2022). In a few years when this technology advances, and maybe becomes sentient, it will save time for everyone and will do the job better than most of us too.
	</p>

	<h3>Disease</h3>
	<p>
	  Sentient AI doesnâ€™t only help increase productivity, but also can help cure diseases. The AI DeepMind has made predictions for nearly 200 million proteins, producing a trove of data that will help medical researchers develop new drugs and vaccines (NYTIMES, 2022). In the future, if AI can develop the new drugs and vaccines itself, then it will be a great thing for all of us.
	</p>

	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
	  Sentient AI may be scary, but it will help humanity in many ways. Productivity and medical advances are just a few things that will be impacted by the future of AI.
