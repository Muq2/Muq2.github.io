	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
	  Biases can impact an individual's or a team's decision making processes in many ways. In this essay, we will explore five biases that may impact our team's decision making and discuss how we can overcome them.
	</p>

	<h3>Confirmation Bias</h3>
	<p>
	  The first bias is confirmation bias, which is the tendency to search for, interpret, and favor information that confirms one's preexisting beliefs (Nickerson, 1998). This bias can lead us to overlook important information that contradicts our beliefs, which can lead to poor decision making. To overcome this bias, we can consciously make an effort to seek out and consider information that challenges our beliefs, and to be open to changing our beliefs if the evidence warrants it.
	</p>

	<h3>Sunk Cost Fallacy</h3>
	<p>
	  Another bias that may impact our decision making is the sunk cost fallacy, which is the tendency to continue investing time, money, or effort into a project or course of action because we have already invested a lot into it, even if it is no longer the best option (Arkes & Blumer, 1985). This bias can lead us to make poor decisions because we are unwilling to admit that our initial investment was a mistake. To overcome this bias, we can remind ourselves that past investments should not influence our current decision making, and we should focus on the potential future benefits and costs of each option.
	</p>

	<h3>Availability Heuristic</h3>
	<p>
	  A third bias that may impact our decision making is the availability heuristic, which is the tendency to base decisions on information that is readily available to us, even if it is not necessarily the most relevant or accurate (Tversky & Kahneman, 1973). This bias can lead us to make decisions based on incomplete or misleading information. To overcome this bias, we can make an effort to actively seek out and consider a wide range of information from multiple sources before making a decision.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Framing Effect</h3>
	<p>
	  A fourth bias that may impact our decision making is the framing effect, which is the tendency to be influenced by the way in which information is presented to us (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). For example, if a decision is presented in a positive frame, we may be more likely to choose it, while if it is presented in a negative frame, we may be less likely to choose it. To overcome this bias, we can try to consider the information objectively, without being influenced by the way it is presented to us.
	</p>

	
	<h3>Anchoring Bias</h3>
	<p>
	  A fifth bias that may impact our decision making is the anchoring bias, which is the tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information we receive when making a decision (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974). This bias can lead us to make decisions based on initial impressions that may not be accurate. To overcome this bias, we can remind ourselves to consider all available information before making a decision, and to avoid relying too heavily on the first piece of information we receive.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Conclusion</h3>
	<p>
	  In conclusion, biases can have a significant impact on our decision making processes. By being aware of these biases and actively taking steps to overcome them, we can improve the quality of our decisions and make more effective choices.
