	&emsp;&emsp;The presence of an “unbroken key” or “lock icon” on the web browser indicates that the HTTPS protocol is in use. The HTTPS is a secure way to connect the user to the remote web server (GRC, 2020). According to the Gibson Research Corporation, the primary reason for this connection is to enhance the users' security and privacy by using “encrypted technology” that no one knows how to break (GRC, 2020).
      </p>
      
      <p>
	&emsp;&emsp;Private institutions did not like the “loss of visibility” caused by HTTPS and as a result, created  “HTTPS Proxy Appliances” (GRC, 2020). HTTPS Proxy Appliances are interceptors between devices used by private institutions to collect data (GRC, 2020). MITMS “circumvent our most basic assumption and guarantee” of Internet browser privacy and security (GRC, 2020).
      </p>

      <p>
	&emsp;&emsp;While there may be no way to prevent this kind of interception it can be reliably detected because it is not possible to completely spoof security certificates (GRC, 2020). This can be done by using cryptographic hashes. Cryptographic hashes are “complex mathematical algorithms” which carefully process every single bit of what they digest (GRC, 2020). The best kind of hash available uses the newer and more secure SHA1 hashing algorithm (GRC, 2020).
      </p>
      
      <p>
	&emsp;&emsp;Schools, governments, and other higher authorities should have some access to the public's connection, but not complete control. For example, schools should be able to know if a student is cheating or accessing forbidden or inappropriate content, but they should not be able to know everything about what the student is doing at home.
