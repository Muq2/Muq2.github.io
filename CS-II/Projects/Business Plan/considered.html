		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aaron-berdecia/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 1</a></h3>
		<p>The first business plan is from Adheesh Katru. I will not be contributing to this plan because it is vague and boring. The project is also out of scope for the timeline provided for the assigment.</p>	
	      </li>
	      
	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aidan-valva/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 2</a></h3>
		<p>The second business plan is from Aidan Valva. I will not be contributing to this plan because I am not interesting in creating bots. This project would also rely on a third party api to operate, making it not viable for a long term business product.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 3</a></h3>
		<p>The third business plan is from Akshay Vemulapalli. I will not be contributing to this plan because it is a clear safety hazard. Letting a computer ai shock people randomly is very dangerous and stupid. Also if someone gets drowsy they can just go to bed instead of getting shocked by their computer.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-eldridge/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 4</a></h3>
		<p>The forth business plan is from Andrew Eldridge. I will not be contributing to this plan because it is weird. If you do not want someone looking at your screen you can just buy an already existing product that blurs your screen when looking at it from a certain angle. Or just alt f4 when someone walks in.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="W3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-nguyen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 5</a></h3>
		<p>The fifth busniness plan is from Andrew Nguyen. I will not be contributing to this plan because it is useless. If someone wants food and does not know what to get they can just open Uber Eats and pick something random. Or they can get up out of their chair and buy something from the grocery store.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrewm-lin/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 6</a></h3>
		<p>The sixth business plan is from Andrewm Lin. I will not be contributing to this plan because something similar already exists. Students can just go to Uber Eats and order food for pickup. Or they can get up and burn some calories because they are already too fat.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/aryan-kulkarni/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 7</a></h3>
		<p>The seventh business plan is from Aryan Kulkarni. I will not be contributing to this plan because it makes no sense. There is no real business plan link and the summary sucks.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/austin-dlugosch/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 8</a></h3>
		<p>The eighth business plan is from Austin Dlugosch. I will not be contributing to this plan because it has nothing to do with technology. This product is just something that I can 3D print in a few hours.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/avanish-jeendru/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 9</a></h3>
		<p>The ninth business plan is from Avanish Jeendru. I will not be contributing to this plan because it is not needed. People can just buy what they think looks good, they do not need a computer to tell them what they want.</p>
	      </li>

	      <li class="w3-padding-16">
		<h3><a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brett-kaplan/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html">Plan 10</a></h3>
	     	<p>The tenth business plan is from Brett Kaplan, Blake Gately, and Logan Rohlfs. I will be contributing to this plan because it is thought out and detailed. Their proposal is to create a system that manages cafeterias at schools. While it is not 100% perfect, it seems to be the best ISP proposal so that is why i will be contributing to this project.</p>
