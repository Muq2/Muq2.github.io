		  <b>Technical challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we encountered many of the same technical challenges. We were still stuck on authentication and REST APIs. However, account creation now works and we can read/write to the database. To figure out authentication and REST APIs I will be researching both of them over the weekend.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Scheduling challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we also encountered many scheduling challeneges. One scheduling issue that we encountered were people not joining the meetings being held in the discord server. This posed an issue because it limited our ability of communicate about the project and talk about the next steps. This issue is still not solved as some people are still not participating.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Interpersonal challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we encountered many interpersonal challeneges. People seem to be inactive and it looks like im the only one doing backend work. This is a huge undertaking and I do not think that I will be able to do it all myself.

		  <b>Technical challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we encountered many technical challenges. One technical challenge that we encountered was user creation and authentication. While working on this feature I hit many roadbumps, the main one being that I am am unable to connect to my own database yet. This made the feature render useless because there was no where to store the data. To solve this issue I emailed Professor Ben-Yakkov asking him about when I will have access to the database.

		  <b>Interpersonal challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we encountered many interpersonal challeneges. People that were not in the group starting joining the discord server and trolling while others were trying to work on the project. This was very annoying and took up some precious time. To solve this issue we added a verification system to the discord server.

		  <b>Technical challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we encountered many technical challenges. One technical challenge that we encountered was database design. While designing the database we had troubles with the StudentAccount table because of FERPA laws. This is an issue because we were planning on storing student data in order to match schedules to that student directly.

		  <br>
		  <b>Scheduling challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we also encountered many scheduling challeneges. One scheduling issue that we encountered were people not joining the discord server. This posed an issue because it limited our ability of communicated about the project and choosing roles. To solve this issue we forced members to join the discord by harassing them in the GitHub issues page.
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Interpersonal challenges:</b><br>
		  This week we encountered one interpersonal challenege. One person on our team spammed 50 random GitHub issues with no descriptions. This made me very mad. To solve this issue I closed all of his issues and replied telling them to learn how to use github.

		  <b>(Software) Development Engineer:</b><br>
		  Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. I think I am suitible for this job because I have years of expeirence developing software. Some challenges I may encounter in this role are endless bugs and other people asking for stupid features to be implemented.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>QA Engineer</b><br>
		  A QA engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before a product launch. I think I am suitible for this job because you dont have to do anything other than clicking buttons until something goes wrong. I would not encounter and challenges in this role because there is nothing challenging about it.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Project Manager</b><br>
		  A Project Manager is responsible for the planning, procurement, execution and completion of a project. I think I am suitible for this job because it is easy. The only challenge I may encounter in this job is having developers that dont do anything.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Product Manager</b><br>
		  Part of a product manager's responsibilities is to search out, gather, handle, and prioritize customer needs and wants. I think I am suitible for this job because it involves no coding and all I have to do is talk to people about how they like the application. The only challenge I would encounter in this job would be if no one has any opinions on the app.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Release Engineer</b><br>
		  Release engineers work with software engineers (SWEs) in product development and SREs to define all the steps required to release software. I think I am suitible for this job because I have released applications before and have expierience. Some challenges I might face in this job are unrealistic deadlines.
