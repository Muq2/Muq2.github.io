		  <b>(Software) Development Engineer:</b><br>
		  Software developers design, program, build, deploy and maintain software using many different skills and tools. I think I am suitible for this job because I have years of expeirence developing software. Some challenges I may encounter in this role are endless bugs and other people asking for stupid features to be implemented.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>QA Engineer</b><br>
		  A QA engineer creates tests that identify issues with software before a product launch. I think I am suitible for this job because you dont have to do anything other than clicking buttons until something goes wrong. I would not encounter and challenges in this role because there is nothing challenging about it.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Project Manager</b><br>
		  A Project Manager is responsible for the planning, procurement, execution and completion of a project. I think I am suitible for this job because it is easy. The only challenge I may encounter in this job is having developers that dont do anything.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Product Manager</b><br>
		  Part of a product manager's responsibilities is to search out, gather, handle, and prioritize customer needs and wants. I think I am suitible for this job because it involves no coding and all I have to do is talk to people about how they like the application. The only challenge I would encounter in this job would be if no one has any opinions on the app.<br>
		  <br>
		  <b>Release Engineer</b><br>
		  Release engineers work with software engineers (SWEs) in product development and SREs to define all the steps required to release software. I think I am suitible for this job because I have released applications before and have expierience. Some challenges I might face in this job are unrealistic deadlines.
